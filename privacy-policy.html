				<h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
				<p>
				We know that you care how information about you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice serves to inform you how we handle the information about you.</p>

				<h5>Gathered information</h5>
				<p>We gather information about you to help us understand your needs better. This is to personalise and continually improve your experience at hattengrp.com. Here are the types of information that we gather:</p>

				<p>Information you give us<br>
				We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests and communicating with you.</p>

				<p>Automatic Information<br>
				We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses hattengrp.com.</p>

				<p>Electronic Communication<br>
				To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>

				<p>Other Sources<br>
				We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</p>

				<h5>The Use of "Cookies"</h5>
				<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. Most web browsers allow web users to exercise control over such files on their computers by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying the user when such a file is stored.<br>
				We use "cookies" to:</p>

				<p>- Know about our audience size. Each browser accessing our site is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. </p>

				<p>- Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of our network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on ours a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.</p>

				<h5>Sharing of information</h5>
				<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below:</p>

				<p>Third-Party Service Providers<br>
				We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

				<p>Promotional Offers<br>
				Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of hattengrp.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.</p>

				<p>Business Transfers<br>
				As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that hattengrp.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

				<p>Protection of hattengrp.com and Others<br>
				We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; or protect the rights, property, or safety of hattengrp.com, our users, or others.</p>

				<p>With Your Consent<br>
				Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
